# Deployment Emoji

I like to prepend each line of the list of changes in a deployment note with an
emoji. This adds something that can be scanned without reading to deployment
notes and emails to get a quick idea of what the deployment's about (bugfixes,
new features, ...). It's also fun.

## Guide

- 🐛 Bugfix
- ✨ New feature
- 🐎 Performance improvement
- 🚨 Tests
- 💅 Cosmetic improvement
- 🔨 Cleanup (removed stuff) (this would be a broom sweeping, preferably)
- 🚧 Gated experiment
- 📚 Documentation
- ⚡️ General update
- 🔖 Version tag
